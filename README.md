# NNU General Education Outcomes Big Data Management Project

This project was created in the Fall Semester of 2022 as part of the Advanced Database/Big Data Management Course at Northwest Nazarene University. 
This project intends to provide NNU's Gen Ed council with useful statistics, visualizations, and other information regarding the GE outcomes compliance status. 
Essentially, this project will aim to:
- **Use historical (Spring 2022) Canvas data to determine university compliance**
  - Scrape GE assignment data from Canvas
  - Clean/Wrangle Canvas outcome data
  - Generate reports based on the Canvas data
  - Visualize reports in PowerBi dashboards
- **Acquire and use current/future (Fall 2022) Canvas data to predict university compliance**
  - Scrape GE assignment data from Canvas
  - Determine which course sections have attached GE outcomes
  - Visualize reports (& potentially make predictions)

## Project Overview
This project has been overhauled several times and now has a new format.
- GE_Outcomes_V0: This directory was created in the first weeks of the project, used simply for testing out different options. As a team, we explored using C#, Python, SQL, Jupyter, Hadoop, PowerBI, and more. This directory is not supported
- GE_Outcomes_V1: This directory was primarily used to clean data. In the process of cleaning the data, we realized more work was needed, which was completed in Version 2. THis directory is not very well supported
- GE_Outcomes_V2: This directory contains all of the current working code and projects.

## Future Work
- Incorporate Qualtrics Data into the Data Pipeline, maybe applying NLP to the answers
- Setup up SSIS, SQL, and PowerBI on a school machine (or server), as these features can be automated but are currently on localhosts.
