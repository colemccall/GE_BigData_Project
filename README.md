# NNU General Education Outcomes Big Data Management Project

This project was created in the Fall Semester of 2022 as part of the Advanced Database/Big Data Management Course at Northwest Nazarene University. 
This project intends to provide NNU's GE council with useful statistics, visualizations, and other information regarding the GE outcomes compliance status. 
Essentially, this project will aim to:
- **Use historical (Spring 2022) Canvas data to determine university compliance**
  - Scrape GE assignment data from Canvas
  - Clean/Wrangle Canvas outcome data
  - Generate reports based on the Canvas data
  - Visualize reports in PowerBi dashboards
- **Acquire and use current/future (Fall 2022) Canvas data to predict university compliance**
  - Scrape GE assignment data from Canvas
  - Determine which course sections have attached GE outcomes
  - Visualize reports (& potentially make predictions)
- **Analyze qualtrics data to gather insight into GE outcomes process**
  - Acquire qualtrics data
  - Apply NLP
